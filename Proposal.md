## PROJECT OUTLINE
As a team, we chose to explore the relationship between global population growth and the rising rate of global warming.

Firstly, we downloaded data in the form of CSV files that relate to global population growth since 1960. We then found further data (CSV files) demonstrating several factors, including; 

Global Warming 

Climate Changes 

Pollution 

Our next task was to clean all of our datasets and assess if and how they can effectively apply to one another. 
 
Once settled on our direction and our choice of data, we added them to an SQLite database.
 
With our data ready, we moved onto ideas on how to best tell our story through visualisations. Using javascript we created various plots.

## DATA SOURCES
Kaggle :

[Pollution](https://www.kaggle.com/sohamgade/plastic-datasets?select=per-capita-plastic-waste-vs-gdp-per-capita.csv)
