## TEAM MEMBERS

## PROJECT OUTLINE
The aim is to download data in the form of csv files that relates to the population over the last few decades. Data demonstrating global warming, climate changes or pollution will also be downloaded as CSV files. This data will then be cleaned and added to a SQLite database. Then using javascript various plots will be created to visually observe the effects of the population increase over the years in relation to global climate changes.
